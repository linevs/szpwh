Will, lu xun and than today, it is a big topic.
Such as lu xun's literature of the lace, are almost every gaming articles of fine quality goods, then the column in the newspaper, is no longer possible to this pen, please.
Late essays by lu xun, especially "and dielectric pavilion" series, I borrow sontag describe bateer words, the old man is more than seventy years ago half consciously enamored of "writing itself" - when lu xun stuffy in Shanghai playing alone, Benjamin, Sartre, bateer, derrida, etc., are still young or high school students.
When the middle of the nineteenth century, marxism in China in the 1930 s was the most avant-garde fashion ideology, was born in guangxu period when lu xun also believes it is materialism a beginner, his own saturated and insight, alone, boldly said, since the words, sensitivity and halfback, hit after the second world war problems and the way of modern writing.
He was totally not by message, by learning to learn and practice this kind of new literary concept, but through his own intrinsic nature, namely what I call "fun", playing with literature, playing time, playing with his own.
/ > hand that afternoon, on the road, I saw a touching scene, still can't forget.
I glance left and right sides cross the street and saw a pair of old man holding hands across the street.
I was surprised, in this town, don't open shake handshandle of husband and wife in the street was rare, and they so big age.
Perhaps people in big cities to relatives, brought the habit of big cities?
But their clothes style shows they are locals.
They at least more than seventy years old, is full of wrinkles on the face, and age spots, some cloudy eyes.
The old man is very small;
The old woman white hair sparse, some tissue.
When crossing the street, the old man looking back and forward looking, and then took the old woman walked slowly.
The old lady limping, she don't see road, follow the old man.
The old man very carefully, for a walk, see, stop, the old lady a stop-and-go tacit understanding.
In this way, a pair of white-haired, doddering people holding hands, slowly to cross the road is not wide.
Look at this scene, my heart is filled with touched, a feeling of penetration through the wind and rain time to warm my heart, let me for a long time silent.
I don't know how to walk, they maintained but I know that the old lady in hand, is the anchorage of life, the old man leading, was formed dozens of years of wind and rain's trust.
I don't know their twilight, if I can have such a scene?
Just think this scene is very beautiful, beautiful, beautiful and easy, beautiful words, is better than millions of busy and noise.
Heart suddenly come thousands of years ago verse "hand, and son xielao", this a pair of old man a hand on the road, the ancient poetry interpretation so true, so perfect.
